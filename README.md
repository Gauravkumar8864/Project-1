# Image Generation using Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI 🎨🧠

This project explores **AI-based image generation** using **Stable Diffusion**, a powerful latent diffusion model, with the help of **ComfyUI** — a modular, node-based GUI that provides intuitive workflows for generating high-quality images from text prompts. Additionally, a **Python GUI built with Tkinter** offers a simplified interface for local use.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a customizable and easy-to-use platform for generating AI-based images from natural language descriptions, while understanding the core concepts of Stable Diffusion, prompt engineering, and diffusion-based generative models.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔤 **Text-to-Image generation** via Stable Diffusion
- 🖼️ **ComfyUI Integration** for modular and visual workflows
- 🖥️ **Custom GUI using Tkinter** to input prompts and generate images locally
- 🧪 Support for **prompt engineering and customization**
- ⚙️ Local image generation without relying on Google Colab or web platforms
